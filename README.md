This program is a counter script that counts the amount of fruit you have ordered from Filbert's Fruit Cart.
The only available fruit is melons.
You input the amount of melons you already have, the amount of melons you wish to buy,
and then the duration of days you would like to receive the melons over and the program calculates
how many melons you receive per day.
